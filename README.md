# Bitcoin-Miners
Simple bitcoin mining algorithms that speed up the process of bitcoin mining,
you can use it in your miners, if you're lucky, it will give you the first nonce value, 
as there can be multiple nonce values, it's a lucky script, if you're lucky, 
the nonce value will be saving you time, power and money. I could speed up the process  to 20% faster, 
you can use multi threading to increase it further, Not maintained anymore.
